# ants_on_string

This repo is for solving the "ants on a string" prolbem in this [fiddler](https://thefiddler.substack.com/i/135921236/making-the-rounds). The problem is as follows:

> I have dropped 10,000 ants randomly onto a ruler that is one meter (i.e., 100 centimeters) long and oriented to point north-south. The ants are of very small size and mass. Each ant walks at a steady pace of one centimeter per second in a straight line parallel to the long edge of the ruler. Their initial direction is randomly either north or south. The ants are all from the same colony and possess and inherited vision problem: they have peripheral vision only. This means that they can collide with each other if they meet head on (although very small, they are large enough to collide). If two ants do collide head on, however, then they each turn around instantly and head back the way they came at their steady pace. With so many ants in one small space, a single ant may experience multiple collisions before it walks off the ruler. So, how long must you wait to be sure that all the ants have walked off the ruler?

Could this be solved better using math than direct simulation? Almost certainly, but this is fun.
